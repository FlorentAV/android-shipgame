# BATTLESHIP ANDROID GAME

This is a school project for Android Development.
This is a small prototype of a Battleship game. It's not the prettiest when it comes to UI or animation, but it's more focused on the logic.
The project is made with Kotlin + Jetpack Compose. I have used some dependencies like Material3 for finished designs.
Firebase is used as database.
